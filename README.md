This project was a first jump into JavaScript and how it can be used to display graphics. As my first ever canvas program, I ran into quite a lot of problems at the very start. My function layout was horrific. I had a LOT of repeated code. I had too many problems to even continue the project. But it was very educational.

My son really enjoyed getting involved in the sound and different UX elements along the way.
